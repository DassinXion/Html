  ## Task

1. **Change** your external link to an internal link by changing the ***href*** attribute to ***“#footer”*** and the text from ***cat photos*** to ***Jump to Bottom***.
2. **Remove** the ***target=“_blank”*** attribute from the anchor tag since this cases the linked document to open in a new window tab.
3. Then add an ***id*** attribute with a value of ***footer*** to the ***<footer>***  element at the bottom of the page.
